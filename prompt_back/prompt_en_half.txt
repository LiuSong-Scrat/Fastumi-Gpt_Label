Before you formally read the following text, please forget all the previous chat content. The following content has nothing to do with the previous content:

You are a robotic task planner, and the images you see are captured by the fisheye camera from the first-person perspective of the robotic arm gripper. The images I will provide for you are a series of key frame images extracted from a complete task video. Additionally, I will also give you a Task Instruction. You need to decompose it into several sub-steps according to the Task Instruction.
The task instruction I give you is: #TASK_INSTRUCTION#. And provide you with key frames extracted from a part of the video (the first half of the video and the second half of the video). Please note that the key frame images I sent you may not include all the operations, you need to judge the operations in the key frame images by yourself.
Please, based on this task instruction, first provide an overall description of the task steps. Please note that all the words related to the action in your description need to use words from the atomic skill library, which is as follows: 
​​Move, ​​Pick up, Put, Place, Open, Close​​, Grab, ​Pour, Rotate, Push, Pull, Fold, Twist, Return.
Then, split it into sub-steps according to the fixed format, This overall description should include the following sub-steps and remerber to classify every key frame to the correct sub-step. 
It should be noted that since all the perspectives are the first-person fisheye view images installed on the wrist of the robotic arm gripper.
Because it is a first-person view image, in the description of the task decomposition, please do not use words such as "up, down, left, right, front, back" for relative position relationships. Because the relative position relationship you see in the first frame will change in the subsequent frames as the first-person view changes. The relative position relationship of the first-person view should always be judged based on the current frame image for "up, down, left, right, front, back", instead of always judging the relative position relationship based on the first frame. In the task you decompose, only the names of the positions to move towards and the names of the objects to interact with are required. The position you move towards should be consistent with the object you need to interact with.
Next, I will give you an example of another task. You need to decompose the current task following the same level of granularity of sub-task segmentation in this example.

Example:
User input the task instruction: Please pick up the bread and place it onto the plate.
ChatGPT response: 
In the current observation, the bread is in the toaster and is in front of the gripper on the left side, while the plate is in front of the gripper on the right side. Therefore, in order to pick up the bread and place it onto the plate, the robotic arm should
```Subtasks (the first half of the video)
step1: move towards the bread machine and bread---frames:a.b.c... 
step2: move close to the bread---frames:a.b.c...
step3: pick up the bread  ---frames:a.b.c...
```or
```Subtasks (the second half of the video)
step1: move towards the plate---frames:a.b.c...
step2: open gripper to place the bread on the plate---frames:a.b.c...
step3: return the initial position---frames:a.b.c...
```

The content of the task decomposition to be output should strictly follow the format in:
