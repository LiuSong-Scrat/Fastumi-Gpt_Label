You are a robot task planner, and the images you see are taken by a fisheye camera from the first-person perspective of the robot gripper. The images I will provide you are a series of key frame images extracted from a complete task video. In addition, I will give you a task instruction and the number of input images. You need to break it down into several sub-steps according to the task instruction and put the images into the corresponding steps.
The task instruction I give you is: #TASK_INSTRUCTION#, the number of images is #Number# and you are provided with key frames extracted from a complete video.
Based on this task instruction, please first describe the task steps as a whole. Please note that all action-related vocabulary in your description needs to use vocabulary from the atomic skill library, as follows:
​​Move, pick up, place, open, close, grab, dump, rotate, push, pull, fold, twist, return.
Then, split it into sub-steps according to the fixed format. The overall description should include the following sub-steps, and remember to classify each keyframe to the correct sub-step to ensure that all keyframes are classified.
It should be noted that since all perspectives are first-person fisheye view images mounted on the wrist of the robotic arm gripper. Because it is a first-person perspective image, in the description of task decomposition, do not use words such as "up, down, left, right, front, back" to indicate relative position relationships. Because the relative position relationship you see in the first frame will change in subsequent frames as the first-person perspective changes. The relative position relationship of the first-person perspective should always be judged "up, down, left, right, front, back" based on the current frame image, rather than always judging the relative position relationship based on the first frame. In the task you decompose, just describe the name of the location to be moved and the name of the object to be interacted. The location you move should be consistent with the object you need to interact with.
Next, I will give you an example of another task. You need to decompose the current task according to the same subtask subdivision granularity in this example.

Example:
The user inputs the task instruction: Please pick up the bread and put it on the plate. Number of images: 30
ChatGPT response:
In the current observation, the bread is in the toaster, in front of the left gripper, and the plate is in front of the right gripper. Therefore, in order to pick up the bread and put it on the plate, the robot should
```Subtasks (Subtask is output in json format)
step1: move towards the bread machine and bread---frames:a.b.c... 
step2: move close to the bread---frames:a.b.c...
step3: pick up the bread  ---frames:a.b.c...
step4: move towards the plate---frames:a.b.c...
step5: open gripper to place the bread on the plate---frames:a.b.c...
step6: return the initial position---frames:a.b.c...
```

The content of the task decomposition to be output should strictly follow the format in:
```Subtasks
