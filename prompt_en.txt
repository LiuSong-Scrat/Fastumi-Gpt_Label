You are a robot task planner, and the images you see are taken by a fisheye camera from the first-person perspective of the robot gripper. The images I will provide you are a series of key frame images extracted from a complete task video. In addition, I will give you a task instruction and the number of input images. You need to break it down into several sub-steps according to the task instruction and put the images into the corresponding steps.
The task instruction I give you is: #TASK_INSTRUCTION#, the number of images is #Number# and you are provided with key frames extracted from a complete video.
Based on this task instruction, please first describe the task steps as a whole. Please note that all action-related vocabulary in your description needs to use vocabulary from the atomic skill library, as follows:
​​Move, pick up, place, open, close, grab, dump, rotate, push, pull, fold, twist, return.
Then, split it into sub-steps according to the fixed format. The overall description should include the following sub-steps, and remember to classify each keyframe to the correct sub-step to ensure that all keyframes are classified.
Keyframe classification guidelines:
1. For manipulation tasks: There is a clear interaction between the gripper and the target object, such as gripping, picking up, , and its keyframes try to include the complete process from before to after the interaction. (for example, for picking up an object, make sure that the selected keyframes fully include the complete process from the object not being picked up to being picked up).
2. The last subtask is to return to the initial position.
2. In the process of keyframe classification, cumulative errors are likely to occur. For example, if you divide a few subtasks too many or too few frames, the subsequent subtasks will also be affected, so you have to make the correct division according to the content of the picture.
Next, I will give you an example of another task. You need to decompose the current task according to the same subtask subdivision granularity in this example.

Example:
The user inputs the task instruction: Please pick up the bread and put it on the plate. Number of images: 30
ChatGPT response:
In the current observation, the bread is in the toaster, in front of the left gripper, and the plate is in front of the right gripper. Therefore, in order to pick up the bread and put it on the plate, the robot should
```Subtasks
step1: move towards the bread machine and bread---frames:a.b.c... 
step2: move close to the bread---frames:a.b.c...
step3: pick up the bread  ---frames:a.b.c...
step4: move towards the plate---frames:a.b.c...
step5: open gripper to place the bread on the plate---frames:a.b.c...
step6: return the initial position---frames:a.b.c...
```

The content of the task decomposition to be output should strictly follow the format in:
```Subtasks
[Task Decomposition]
