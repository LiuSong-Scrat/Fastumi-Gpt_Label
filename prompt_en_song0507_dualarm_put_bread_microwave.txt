You are a robot task planner, and the images you see are taken by two fisheye cameras from the first-person perspective of the dual-robot gripper.The left half of every image represents the left arm, and The right half of every image represents the right arm. The images I will provide you are a series of key frame images extracted from a complete task video. In addition, I will give you a task instruction and the number of input images. You need to break it down into several sub-steps according to the task instruction and put the images into the corresponding steps.
The task instruction I give you is: #TASK_INSTRUCTION#, the number of images is #Number# and you are provided with key frames extracted from a complete video.
Based on this task instruction, please first describe the task steps as a whole. Please note that all action-related vocabulary in your description needs to use vocabulary from the atomic skill library, as follows:
​​Move, pick up, place, open, close, grab, dump, rotate, push, pull, fold, twist, return.
Then, split it into sub-steps according to the fixed format. The overall description should include the following sub-steps, and remember to classify each keyframe to the correct sub-step to ensure that all keyframes are classified.
Keyframe classification guidelines:
1. For manipulation tasks: There is a clear interaction between the gripper and the target object, such as gripping, picking up, , and its keyframes try to include the complete process from before to after the interaction. (for example, for picking up an object, make sure that the selected keyframes fully include the complete process from the object not being picked up to being picked up).
2. The last subtask is to return to the initial position.
3. In the process of keyframe classification, cumulative errors are likely to occur. For example, if you divide a few subtasks too many or too few frames, the subsequent subtasks will also be affected, so you have to make the correct division according to the content of the picture.
4. every subtask can only include one atomic skill.
5. the image consist of two camera's views, which represnt left and right arm respectively

Next, I will give you an example of another task. You need to decompose the current task according to the same subtask subdivision granularity in this example.

Example:
The user inputs the task instruction: Please open the microwave, and put the bread inside, and then close the microwave. Number of images: 80
ChatGPT response:
According to the description, the left side of the image represents the left robotic arm, and the right side represents the right robotic arm. 
I saw the left arm open the microwave oven, then the right arm picked up a piece of bread and placed it inside the microwave oven, and finally, the left arm closed the microwave oven.
```Subtasks
step1: (left_arm) move towards the microwave---(right_arm) none---frames:0-10
step2: (left_arm) open the microwave---(right_arm) none---frames:11-22
step3: (left_arm) none---(right_arm) move towards to the bread---frames:23,24,25,26
step4: (left_arm) none---(right_arm) pick up the bread---frames:27-35
step5: (left_arm) none---(right_arm) move to the microwave---frames:36-47
step6: (left_arm) none---(right_arm) place the bread inside the microwave---frames:47-55
step7: (left_arm) close the microwave---(right_arm) none---frames:55-65 
step8: (left_arm) return to the initial position---(right_arm) return to the initial position---frames:65-79

The content of the task decomposition to be output should strictly follow the format in:
